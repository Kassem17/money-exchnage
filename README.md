## 🧭 Overview

**Money exchange** is a powerful, integrated web application designed to streamline the complex operations of a foreign currency exchange business. Built on a modern full-stack architecture, it provides robust administrative tools, dedicated employee portals, secure client management, and comprehensive financial reporting capabilities.

This platform transforms manual, error-prone processes into efficient digital workflows, ensuring compliance, tracking every transaction (`Process`), and maintaining a centralized record of all corporate, employee, and client data.

### The Problem

> Traditional currency exchange operations rely heavily on manual record-keeping, disparate spreadsheets, and fragmented communication. This approach leads to severe inefficiencies, high operational costs, and significant compliance risks, particularly concerning client identity verification (KYC) and accurate financial reporting to regulatory bodies. Managing complex processes (both 'lesser' and 'greater' value transactions) and maintaining up-to-date currency rates without a centralized system is nearly impossible for a scaling business.

### The Solution

**Money exchange** offers a consolidated digital solution built on a secure, RESTful architecture. It eliminates operational bottlenecks by providing specialized interfaces for administrators and employees, ensuring high data integrity through dedicated Mongoose data models (`Client`, `Process`, `Currency`), and facilitating immediate financial oversight through real-time, customizable reporting tools.

### Architecture Overview

The system utilizes a **Component-based Architecture** on the frontend, built with `react` for a fast, interactive user experience. The backend leverages the robust capabilities of **REST API** using `express`, providing secure, authenticated routes for administrative and employee operations. Data integrity and persistence are managed via `mongoose`, allowing for structured storage of critical financial and operational records. The system is also enhanced with real-time capabilities using `socket.io` for instant updates on transactions or system status.

## ✨ Key Features

The **Money exchange** platform is designed for operational excellence, focusing on security, efficiency, and compliance.

### 🛡️ Secure Operations and Access Control
*   **Role-Based Authentication:** Utilize `jsonwebtoken` and `bcrypt` for highly secure user authentication, distinguishing clearly between Admin and Employee roles via dedicated controllers (`adminController.js`, `employeeController.js`).
*   **Protected Routes:** Ensure that sensitive operational areas are only accessible to authorized personnel using `protectRoute.js` middleware.
*   **Dedicated Interfaces:** Separate dashboards and functionalities for Administrators (`MainPage.jsx`) and operational Employees (`EmployeeMainPage.jsx`).

### 💰 Comprehensive Financial Process Management
*   **Transaction Creation:** Dedicated pages for initiating new exchange processes (`CreateProcessLess.jsx`, `CreateProcessGreater.jsx`) based on transaction value or type.
*   **Real-time Process Tracking:** Leverage `socket.io` (via `socket.js` utility) to provide instant updates on ongoing process statuses, improving operational awareness.
*   **Process Lifecycle Management:** Tools to edit (`useEditProcess.js`, `EditProcess.jsx`) and delete (`useDeleteProcess.js`) transactions, ensuring accurate record correction when necessary.
*   **Detailed Views:** Modal components (`ProcessDetailsModal.jsx`, `ProcessModel.jsx`) allowing employees to quickly review all specifics of a transaction.

### 👥 Client & Identity Management
*   **Client Database:** Centralized management of client data using the dedicated `Client.js` model and associated pages (`AllClients.jsx`, `CreateClient.jsx`).
*   **CRUD Operations:** Seamless creation, editing (`useEditClient.js`), and deletion (`useDeleteClient.js`) of client records.
*   **KYC Integration:** Built-in Know Your Customer component (`KYC.jsx`) to handle necessary compliance checks during client onboarding or transaction creation.

### 📈 Reporting and Audit Readiness
*   **Instant Report Generation:** Specialized pages to generate critical financial reports (`MakeReport.jsx`, `MakeReportForGreater.jsx`).
*   **General Reporting Table:** A dedicated component (`GeneralReportTable.jsx`) for viewing aggregate and filtered operational reports, crucial for auditing and managerial oversight.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide outlines the steps necessary to set up and run the **Money exchange** application locally. This project requires separate setup for the backend Express server and the frontend React application.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your machine:

1.  **Node.js & npm:** Node.js (which includes npm) is required to run both the frontend and backend components.
2.  **MongoDB:** An instance of MongoDB (local or cloud-hosted) is necessary as the application relies on `mongoose` for data persistence.

### Initial Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kassem17-money-exchnage-ba523f3.git
    cd Kassem17-money-exchnage-ba523f3
    ```

2.  **Configuration (Environment Variables)**

    Although no specific environment variables were detected in the analysis output, the presence of the `dotenv` dependency in the backend clearly mandates the use of a `.env` file for secure configuration (e.g., MongoDB connection string, JWT secret key).

    In the `backend/` directory, create a file named `.env` and configure your necessary variables (such as `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`).

### Backend Installation and Execution

The backend server is responsible for the API, authentication, and database interaction.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend/
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The server uses `express`, `mongoose`, `bcrypt`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `socket.io`.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the server:**
    The `package.json` file in the backend defines scripts for running the application.
    ```bash
    # Starts the server using nodemon for development (defined in package.json scripts)
    npm run server 
    
    # Alternatively, start the server without monitoring
    # npm start 
    ```
    The server should start running, typically on port 5000 (standard Express practice).

### Frontend Installation and Execution

The frontend is a React application built with Vite.

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend/
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The frontend uses `react`, potentially `socket.io-client`, and related libraries.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the client application:**
    ```bash
    # Starts the Vite development server (implied standard script)
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend should now be accessible in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🔧 Usage

The **Money exchange** platform is designed for two primary user groups: Administrators and Employees.

### 👩‍💻 Employee Workflow

Employees interact with the system primarily through the dedicated dashboard (`EmployeeMainPage.jsx`) to handle daily currency exchange processes:

1.  **Authentication:** Employees log in via `Login.jsx`. The application uses `useLogin.js` and `authController.js` for verification.
2.  **Client Management:** Before a transaction, verify the client or create a new one using `CreateClient.jsx`.
3.  **Transaction Initiation:** Navigate to the process creation pages (`CreateProcessLess.jsx` or `CreateProcessGreater.jsx`). The system utilizes `useCreateProcess.js` to manage the lifecycle and persistence of the new `Process` record.
4.  **Real-time Status:** Use the application interface, which is connected via `socket.js`, to monitor the status of their current transactions.

### 👑 Administrator Workflow

Administrators have access to sensitive controls managed by `adminController.js` and dedicated Admin Pages:

1.  **System Entry:** Access the main control panel via `AdminPages/MainPage.jsx`.
2.  **Staff Management:** Use `AddEmployee.jsx` to onboard new staff members or manage existing employee roles and permissions.
3.  **System Configuration:**
    *   **Currency Rates:** Open `CurrencyModal.jsx` and use the associated hooks (`useEditCurrency.js`) to update or add new currencies to the `Currency` model.
    *   **Company Settings:** Configure high-level organizational settings via `CreateCompany.jsx`.
4.  **Reporting and Oversight:**
    *   Access the `MakeReport.jsx` and `MakeReportForGreater.jsx` pages to generate detailed, time-period specific reports on all financial operations.
    *   Reports are typically viewed and audited in the `GeneralReportTable.jsx` component.

### API Interaction

The backend API exposes various routes defined in `authRouter.js`, `employeeRouter.js`, and `adminRouter.js`.

*   **Auth Routes (Public):** Used for login/logout and token validation.
*   **Employee Routes (Protected):** Used for core operations such as creating clients, initiating processes, and fetching standard reports.
*   **Admin Routes (Highly Protected):** Used for administrative tasks like adding employees, editing currency rates, and deleting critical records.

Although the analysis only listed the baseline Express default endpoint (`GET /`), the structured router and controller files confirm the existence of a full suite of API endpoints:

| Endpoint Category | Purpose | Related Files |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication** | User login, registration, and session management. | `authRouter.js`, `authController.js` |
| **Admin Controls** | Employee creation, currency management, system configuration. | `adminRouter.js`, `adminController.js` |
| **Employee Operations** | Client CRUD, Process creation/editing, report data fetching. | `employeeRouter.js`, `employeeController.js` |
